Example 21: prompt caching: stop paying full price for a repeated prefix.

Many real apps send the *same* long prefix on every request: a big system prompt,
a tool catalog, a document you're asking many questions about. Re-processing those
identical input tokens every time is wasteful, so OpenAI **caches** them.

The good news: on OpenAI it's **automatic**. Any request whose prompt is ≥1024
tokens has its longest matching *prefix* cached; identical prefixes on later
requests are read from cache at a **discount** (cached input tokens are billed at
a fraction of the normal input price) and processed faster. You don't call a
special endpoint. You just structure prompts so the *stable* part comes first and
the *variable* part (the user's actual question) comes last.

This script sends two requests that share a long, identical system prefix, then
reads `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` to show the cache kicking in on
the second call.

The one design rule: **put the constant stuff at the front, the variable stuff at
the back.** A cache only helps the prefix that's byte-for-byte identical.

Run it:
