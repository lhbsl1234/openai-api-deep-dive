Example 14: Pydantic validation of responses.

Example 09 made the model return JSON matching a hand-written JSON Schema, then
parsed it with `json.loads()` into a plain dict. That works, but you're left
holding an untyped dict: no editor autocomplete, no real validation, and a typo
like `data["sumary"]` blows up only at runtime.

The better way: define your shape as a **Pydantic model** and let the SDK do the
rest. `client.chat.completions.parse(...)` (the structured-outputs helper):

  - converts your model into a strict JSON Schema and sends it for you,
  - constrains the model to match it,
  - and hands back an *already-validated instance of your model* on
    `message.parsed`: typed attributes, not a dict.

Why this beats a raw dict:
  - **Types**: `review.bugs[0].severity` autocompletes and is checked.
  - **Validation**: Pydantic enforces constraints (enums, ranges, lengths). If
    the data doesn't fit, you get a clear `ValidationError` instead of a
    land-mine deep in your code.
  - **Less code**: no schema dict to maintain, no manual `json.loads`.

Run it:
