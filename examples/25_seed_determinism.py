Example 25: seed & reproducibility: pinning down a random model.

Generation is random by default (that's what `temperature` controls; see example 03).
Run the same prompt twice and you get two different answers. Sometimes you want the
*opposite*: the same input to produce the same output, for tests, for caching, for
debugging, for reproducible evals.

`seed=<int>` is the lever: it fixes the random state the model samples from, so the
*same* seed + same inputs reproduce the *same* output, even with temperature turned
up. This script proves that directly, running at `temperature=0.9` (real randomness)
so the seed's effect is unmistakable, rather than hiding behind `temperature=0`'s
already-deterministic greedy decoding (where a seed wouldn't visibly be doing much).

  - `seed=42` twice -> identical output (the seed pins the randomness down).
  - `seed=None` twice -> different output (nothing pins it down, so it's free to vary).

In production you'd typically combine `temperature=0` *and* a fixed `seed`. temp=0
removes most of the variation by always taking the most likely token, and the seed
locks down whatever tie-breaking remains. This script isolates the seed's own effect
by leaving temperature high, so you can see it doing the work on its own.

The honest caveat either way: this is **best-effort, not a guarantee.** OpenAI may
change the backend (detectable via the `system_fingerprint` field: if it changes,
determinism can break). Treat seed as "much more reproducible," not "byte-identical
forever."

Run it:
