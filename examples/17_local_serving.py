Example 17: Local models: the same client, a different base_url.

The big idea of the whole repo, "send messages, get a message", isn't tied to
OpenAI's servers. Local runtimes like **Ollama** and **llama.cpp** expose an
*OpenAI-compatible* endpoint, so the exact same `openai` SDK talks to a model
running on your own machine. You change two things and nothing else:

    client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1", api_key="ollama")

`base_url` points at the local server; `api_key` is required by the SDK but
ignored by the local server (any non-empty string works). Everything you learned 
roles, the sampling knobs, streaming, token usage, works unchanged.

Why bother? Privacy (data never leaves the machine), cost (no per-token bill),
and offline use. The trade-off is you run and scale the server yourself, and the
small local models are less capable than the hosted frontier ones.

    secrun python examples/17_local_serving.py

This example needs a local server running; with none, it prints how to start one
and exits cleanly (no key, no crash).

Setup (one time):
    1. Install Ollama from https://ollama.com
    2. Pull a small model:   ollama pull llama3.2
    3. Re-run this script.   (Ollama serves on localhost:11434 automatically.)
