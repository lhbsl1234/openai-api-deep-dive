Example 20: the Batch API: half price, for work that isn't urgent.

Every example so far made *synchronous* calls: you ask, you wait, you get an
answer. But a lot of real LLM work isn't interactive: classify 10,000 reviews,
summarize a backlog of tickets, generate embeddings for a corpus. For that, the
**Batch API** is the right tool: you upload a file of requests, OpenAI processes
them within 24 hours, and you pay **50% less** per token. No rate-limit juggling,
no `for` loop hammering the endpoint.

The lifecycle (it mirrors a job queue):

  1. Build a JSONL file, one request per line, each with a `custom_id`.
  2. Upload it          (files.create, purpose="batch").
  3. Create the batch   (batches.create), which starts processing.
  4. Poll until done    (batches.retrieve); status goes validating -> in_progress
                        -> completed.
  5. Download results   (files.content), a JSONL keyed by your custom_ids.

This script builds a tiny 3-request batch and submits it. Because a batch can take
minutes to (up to) 24 hours, it does NOT block waiting. It prints the batch id and
shows you how to check on it and fetch results. Re-run with the id to poll.

Run it:

    secrun python examples/20_batch_api.py            # create a batch
    secrun python examples/20_batch_api.py <batch_id> # check status / fetch results
