"""
Example 13: errors, timeouts, and retries (surviving the real world).

Every example so far assumed the happy path: the request succeeds. In
production it often won't. The network blips, you hit a rate limit, a model
name has a typo, the service is briefly overloaded. Code that ignores this
crashes on the first hiccup.

The good news: the OpenAI SDK already does most of the work for you.

  >> The client AUTOMATICALLY RETRIES transient failures (429 rate limits,
  >> 5xx server errors, connection errors) with exponential backoff.
  >> The default is 2 retries. You usually don't need a retry loop at all.

What you DO need is two things:

  1. Configure the client's `timeout` and `max_retries` for your use case.
  2. Catch the SDK's typed exceptions so you can react differently to a
     "fix your request" error (bad key, bad model, don't retry) versus a
     "try again later" error (rate limit, overload, which the SDK already did).

The exceptions form a hierarchy. Catch the SPECIFIC ones you handle specially,
then a broad `APIError` as a backstop: most specific first, or the broad one
shadows the rest.

Run it:

    secrun python examples/13_error_handling.py

It deliberately requests a nonexistent model to show a NotFoundError being
caught, then makes a normal call with tuned timeout/retry settings.
