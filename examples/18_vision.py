Example 18: vision: sending an image alongside text.

Everything so far sent only text. Multimodal models also accept *images* in the
same message, so you can ask "what's in this picture?", read a screenshot, or
pull data out of a photo of a receipt. The request shape barely changes: instead
of a plain string, the user message's `content` becomes a *list of parts*, where
each part is either `{"type": "text", ...}` or `{"type": "image_url", ...}`.

Two ways to provide the image, both shown here:
  - a public URL the model can fetch, or
  - a local file you read and inline as a base64 `data:` URI (no public hosting
    needed, which is what real apps usually do).

Images are billed as tokens too, and the count scales with the image's pixel
dimensions: a big screenshot can cost more than a page of text. Downscale before
sending if you care about cost.

Run it (uses a public sample image):

    secrun python examples/18_vision.py

    # or point it at your own local image (sent as base64):
    secrun python examples/18_vision.py path/to/image.png
