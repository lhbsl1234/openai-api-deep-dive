"""
Example 10: function / tool calling.

The model can't run code, browse, or query your database. But it *can* tell you
"I'd like you to call this function with these arguments", and then you run the
function and hand the result back. This is "tool calling," and it's how chatbots
get the ability to actually *do* things.

The dance has four steps:

  1. You describe your tools (name, what they do, their parameters as a schema)
     and send them alongside the user's message.
  2. The model replies not with prose but with a `tool_calls` request: which
     function, and what arguments (as JSON).
  3. YOU execute the real function with those arguments.
  4. You send the result back (as a `tool` role message) and the model writes the
     final natural-language answer using it.

The model never runs your code. It only *asks*. You stay in control of what
actually executes.

Run it:
