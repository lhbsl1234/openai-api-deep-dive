Example 11: embeddings & semantic similarity.

So far every example used a *chat* model that produces text. Embeddings are
different: an embeddings model turns a piece of text into a list of numbers (a
"vector") that captures its *meaning*. Texts with similar meaning end up with
similar vectors, even if they share no words.

This is the engine behind semantic search, recommendations, clustering, and
"retrieval-augmented generation" (RAG), where you find the most relevant
documents to stuff into a prompt.

How we measure "similar": **cosine similarity**, the cosine of the angle between
two vectors. It ranges from -1 (opposite) to 1 (identical direction). Closer to 1
means more similar in meaning.

This example uses a different endpoint, `client.embeddings.create`, and a
cheap, dedicated model (`text-embedding-3-small`). No third-party math libraries
needed; we compute cosine similarity by hand.

Run it:
