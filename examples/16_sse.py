Example 16: Server-Sent Events (SSE): the protocol under streaming.

Every streaming AI response, in the ChatGPT UI, in examples/08_streaming.py,
and in every production assistant, travels over a protocol called Server-Sent
Events (SSE). The OpenAI SDK parses it for you, but knowing the raw format
pays off: it's exactly what you'll produce when you build a backend that
forwards AI tokens to a browser.

The SSE wire format
-------------------
SSE is an ordinary HTTP response that stays open and drips data until the
server says it's done. The server sets:

    Content-Type: text/event-stream

Then sends events as plain text lines, each event terminated by a blank line:

    data: {"id":"chatcmpl-...","choices":[{"delta":{"content":"Hello"}}]}\n
    \n
    data: {"id":"chatcmpl-...","choices":[{"delta":{"content":" world"}}]}\n
    \n
    data: [DONE]\n
    \n

Rules:
  - Lines starting with `data:` hold the payload.
  - A blank line terminates the current event.
  - `data: [DONE]` signals the end (OpenAI-specific; the SDK silently swallows it).
  - Other SSE fields (`event:`, `id:`, `retry:`) are valid per spec but
    OpenAI only uses `data:`.

This example has three parts:

  Part 1, raw events: print each chunk exactly as it arrives on the wire.
           The SDK gives us the parsed object; we format it back to text so
           you can see what the HTTP layer actually looks like.

  Part 2, token timing: measure time-to-first-token and generation throughput
           to understand the rhythm of incremental delivery.

  Part 3, partial accumulation: show how a server buffers tokens in memory
           to track progress and recover from interruptions.

The capstone that puts all of this into practice is hands_on/streaming_server.py
a FastAPI server that streams tokens over SSE to a real browser.

Key takeaway
------------
In a streaming server, each `piece` above becomes one SSE event you yield
to the browser:

    yield f"data: {json.dumps({'type': 'token', 'text': piece})}\\n\\n"

The browser's fetch + ReadableStream parses those lines and calls your handler
for each event, exactly the same loop but running client-side. See
hands_on/streaming_server.py for the full production-ready implementation.
