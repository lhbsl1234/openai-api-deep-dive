Example 19: reasoning models (the o-series): think first, answer second.

The chat models you've used so far answer immediately, token by token. OpenAI's
*reasoning* models (the o-series: o1, o3, o4-mini, and the GPT-5 reasoning
tiers) do something different: before they write a visible answer, they generate
a private chain of **reasoning tokens** you never see, working the problem out
internally. That makes them much stronger at math, logic, coding, and multi-step
planning, at the cost of higher latency and more tokens billed.

Three things change about the request:

  1. You don't set `temperature`/`top_p`; reasoning models ignore sampling knobs.
     You steer effort with `reasoning_effort` instead ("low" | "medium" | "high"):
     more effort = more thinking tokens = better on hard problems, slower & pricier.
  2. The system role is called `developer` (system still works, but `developer`
     is the modern name for these models).
  3. `usage` now reports `reasoning_tokens`: hidden thinking you still pay for
     under `completion_tokens_details`.

Use a reasoning model when the task is genuinely hard; a normal model like
gpt-4o-mini is cheaper and faster for everyday requests.

Run it:
