"""
Example 12: multi-turn conversations (the API has no memory).

Here's the single most common surprise for newcomers:

  >> The API is STATELESS. It remembers nothing between requests. If you want the
  >> model to "remember" what was said earlier, *you* have to send the whole
  >> conversation back every single time.

There's no session, no conversation ID, no server-side history. Each call to
`chat.completions.create` is judged entirely on the `messages` list you hand it
right then. The illusion of a chatbot that remembers is built by you, the
caller, by appending each new turn to a growing list:

    [user] -> [user, assistant] -> [user, assistant, user, assistant] -> ...

That's it. Every example so far sent a fixed list; this one *grows* the list as
the conversation goes, which is all a chat app really is.

Run it (type a few messages, then `quit`):

    secrun python examples/12_conversation.py

Try this to feel the statelessness: tell it your name, then ask "what's my
name?". It works, because the earlier turns are still in the list. Now look at
`trim_history()` below: drop the early turns and the model genuinely forgets,
because for the model the conversation *is* whatever list you send.
