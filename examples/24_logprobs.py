Example 24: logprobs: how *confident* was the model?

A normal response gives you the model's chosen words but says nothing about how
sure it was. Set `logprobs=True` and the API also returns, for each token it
generated, the **log-probability** it assigned, and with `top_logprobs=k`, the
k most likely alternatives it considered at that position.

Why you'd want this:
  - **Confidence scoring.** Turn a log-prob into a probability (`math.exp`) to get a
    0–1 confidence per token. Useful to flag shaky answers for review.
  - **Classification with calibration.** For a one-token answer ("yes"/"no",
    "positive"/"negative"), the alternatives' probabilities tell you *how close*
    the call was, far more informative than the bare label.
  - **Debugging.** See where the model was torn between two continuations.

CAVEAT: confidence is not the same as correctness. A logprob measures how
peaked the model's next-token distribution was, given its training data. It
says nothing about whether the model actually *knows* the answer. Ask it
something unknowable (future weather, an unpublished number) and forced into
a one-word reply, it will often still commit to a single token with near-100%
"confidence". It's just reproducing the most statistically common phrasing
for that kind of question, not reporting epistemic uncertainty. Low-confidence,
split logprobs show up when the model is genuinely torn between plausible
continuations (ambiguous classification, or tasks it tends to get wrong) 
not when it lacks information it never had a way to access.

This script asks a yes/no question, then prints the probability of the answer
token and the runners-up it weighed.
